## Running HotTowel   

### Linting
 - Run code analysis using `gulp vet`. This runs jshint, jscs, and plato.

### Tests
 - Run the unit tests using `gulp test` (via karma, mocha, sinon).

### Running in dev mode
 - Run the project with `gulp serve-dev`

 - opens it in a browser and updates the browser with any files changes.

### Building the project
 - Build the optimized project using `gulp build`
 - This create the optimized code for the project and puts it in the build folder

### Running the optimized code
 - Run the optimize project from the build folder with `gulp serve-build`

## Exploring HotTowel
HotTowel Angular starter project


### Serving Development Code

- `gulp serve-dev`

    Serves the development code and launches it in a browser. The goal of building for development is to do it as fast as possible, to keep development moving efficiently. This task serves all code from the source folders and compiles less to css in a temp folder.

- `gulp serve-dev --nosync`

    Serves the development code without launching the browser.

- `gulp serve-dev --debug`

    Launch debugger with node-inspector.

- `gulp serve-dev --debug-brk`

    Launch debugger and break on 1st line with node-inspector.

### Building Production Code

- `gulp optimize`

    Optimize all javascript and styles, move to a build folder, and inject them into the new index.html

- `gulp build`

    Copies all fonts, copies images and runs `gulp optimize` to build the production code to the build folder.

### Serving Production Code

- `gulp serve-build`

    Serve the optimized code from the build folder and launch it in a browser.

- `gulp serve-build --nosync`

    Serve the optimized code from the build folder and manually launch the browser.

- `gulp serve-build --debug`

    Launch debugger with node-inspector.

- `gulp serve-build --debug-brk`

    Launch debugger and break on 1st line with node-inspector.

### Bumping Versions

- `gulp bump`

    Bump the minor version using semver.
    --type=patch // default
    --type=minor
    --type=major
    --type=pre
    --ver=1.2.3 // specific version
